     <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Sports are physical activities that involve skill, strategy, and competition. 
        They can be played individually or in teams and are enjoyed by people all around the world.
         Sports can be categorized into various types such as team sports (like soccer, basketball, 
         and hockey), individual sports (like tennis, golf, and swimming), and combat sports (like boxing,
          martial arts, and wrestling). Participating in sports can have numerous benefits, including improving

            Graduation for basic school children is an important milestone in their educational journey. 
            It typically marks the completion of a certain level of education, such as elementary or primary
             school. Graduation ceremonies are often held to celebrate the achievements of the students and to
              recognize their hard work and dedication. During these ceremonies, students may receive certificates 
              or diplomas as a symbol of their accomplishment. Graduation is a time of reflection and celebration, 
              as students prepare to move on to the next phase of their education. It is a time to acknowledge their
               growth, both academically and personally, and to look forward to new opportunities and challenges.
